An Abstract Data Type (ADT) consists of the following.

A data structure: a collection of data, together with the structure, organization, and properties of that data.

The operations that can be performed: what the user can do to look at, manipulate or change the data.

The interface between the ADT and the user -- that is, the operations that the user is able to perform -- provides a contract between the ADT and the user.

The ADT supplies a set of operations and guarantees what the outcome of each operation will be.

The user agrees to use only the operations supplied by the interface.

The interface hides implementation details. This allows the developer to change those implementation details without affecting the user's code.
